### [Click here to view Demo](https://astro-cosmic-blog.netlify.app/)

## Prerequisites
- Node (I recommend using latest version)
- Cosmic CMS account


## Getting Started
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitkharche/astro-cosmic-app.git
cd astro-cosmic-app
npm install 
```

## Create Cosmic Bucket
Create a [free account on Cosmic](https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup). If this is your first time using Cosmic, you'll see a short tutorial which will introduce some of the data types we'll be using - buckets, objects, and metafields.

Create a new empty bucket & name it coffee-blog. For each blog post, we will have three object types:
- Title
- Content
- Image

So, go ahead and add these properties in your buckets along with some data for those objects. [If you're having trouble with Buckets, Objects, or Metafields, go ahead and read the Getting Started page really quickly for some startup instructions](https://www.cosmicjs.com/getting-started)

### Keys
In .env file,
- update your Cosmic bucket slug and read key

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
